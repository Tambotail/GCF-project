    <hr><h1>BMW M5</h1><hr><br>

    <p>The BMW M5 is a high-performance version of the BMW 5 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH, built since 1984 with periodic interruptions. The M5 has continuously been produced in the saloon body style, in some countries also as an estate.[1][2][3]

The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[4] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</p>

    <h2>E28 M5 (1984–1988)</h2><br><hr>
    The first BMW M5, based on the E28 5 Series, was manufactured from October 1984 to June 1988.[6] It made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show in February 1985.[7] It was based on the 535i chassis with various mechanical changes, most notably the M88/3 engine (shared with the E24 M635CSi grand tourer coupé) which was an updated version of the engine used in the M1 sports car.[6] At its launch, the E28 M5 was the fastest production saloon in the world.[4]
</p>


<p>The official markets for the E28 M5 were Europe, Great Britain, the United States, Canada, and South Africa. The European and South African cars used the M88/3 engine which has a power output of 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp).[8]

Cars sold in the United States and Canada used a detuned version of the M88/3 called the S38B35, which was equipped with a catalytic converter and has a power output of 191 kW (256 hp).[9] Due to an extended production run that exceeded BMW's original forecast of production volumes, a class action lawsuit was launched by owners in the United States. The results of this class action was that owners were given a voucher for US$4,000 in 1993.[10] Production of North American specification M5 commenced in November 1986 and ended in November 1987.[11]</p><br><br>

    <hr><h2>E34 M5 (1988–1995) </h2><br><hr><br>
    The E34 generation of the M5 was produced from September 1988 to August 1995. Powered by the S38 straight-six engine, an evolution of the previous generation's straight-six, the E34 was initially produced in a saloon body style, with a second LHD Touring (estate/wagon) version following in 1992.[18]
    <br>
    Production of M5 models began with the painted bodyshell of an E34 5 Series at the BMW Dingolfing plant.[19] The shells were then transported to BMW M GmbH in Garching, where the car was assembled by hand over a period of two weeks.[20][21] Only the South African M5 was entirely assembled at the Rosslyn, South Africa assembly plant from complete knock-down kits supplied from Garching, Germany. The M5 Touring, which was BMW M Division's first estate as well as the last hand-built M car, saw 891 units produced. Total production of the E34 M5 was 12,254 units, of which 8,344 were 3.6-litre and 3,910 were 3.8-litre. In the North American market, only the 3.6-litre version was sold (model years 1991–1993).[19]

    <hr><h2>M-System wheels</h2><br><hr><br>
    The M5 came with an unusual wheel design. From 1988 to 1992 the M5 featured the three-piece Style 20 "M-System" wheels, which consisted of magnesium, unidirectional bolted-on wheel covers and an aluminium assembly with concentric fins that bolt on to the front of the black, 5-spoke forged aluminium wheel. According to BMW, the cover increased outside airflow to the brake assembly by 25 percent to improve cooling.

In 1992 BMW changed the design to the "M-System II" (nicknamed "throwing stars") which improved brake cooling from the combination of the larger openings and fins placed in the driving direction.[27]

In May 1994, the M5 switched to 18-inch Style 37 "M Parallel" wheels that did away with the finned cover entirely.[19]
